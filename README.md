## 🎉 Introduction

The AI-Powered Appointment Scheduling Assistant is an advanced chatbot system designed to streamline the process of scheduling medical appointments. It leverages natural language processing and machine learning to provide a seamless, efficient, and patient-centric scheduling experience for healthcare facilities.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The current process of scheduling and managing medical appointments presents challenges for both patients and healthcare providers. Inefficiencies in the existing system can lead to suboptimal experiences and resource allocation. This project aims to address these issues by providing an AI-powered solution that enhances the appointment booking process.
